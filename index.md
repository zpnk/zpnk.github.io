## Who is this?!

Hey I'm Zach. I rock guitar & code. I'm a wannabe surfer. I've driven back and forth across the US more times then I can count, and lived in at least six states. Right now I'm living in Las Vegas and really loving the sun, although the beach is a little far for that whole surfer thing!

Anyway, I like making things - specifically, nice things for the internet where I find that clean design, combined with beautiful code, can create magical experiences. How's that for a cliche catchphrase?!

Currently, I am looking for a junior front-end (and/or) developer position in the Vegas area. If you think I'd be a good fit [I'd love to hear from you](mailto:z [at] zpnk.me?subject=Come work with us, Zach!).

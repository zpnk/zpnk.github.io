Today is exactly two weeks since I turned 21.

It feels like time has flown by since I turned 20, but at the same time it seems like forever ago. Here's what happened in my 20th year:

### Moved to Las Vegas

Last June I had just moved to Las Vegas from Portland. Having left business school, I deceided to refocus my goals on becoming a software engineer, due to my early interest in building websites. After moving, I started attending the local [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) meetup, shortly followed by the three day [Ruby Weekend](http://rubyweekend.com/) workshop. This was my first taste of real web development, and after the weekend I spent two weeks improving the app I made there for the challenge, which I won.

On my actual birthday I went out for dinner with my family and some friends. I was stressed out alot around this time, trying to organize going to [ASU](http://innovation.asu.edu/degrees-programs/engineering-computing-systems/software-engineering-undergraduate) in the fall. I got as far as picking classes, and even a dorm assignment, before realizing the costs where just too high. I then spent most of June and July teaching myself and improving my skills.

### Won Startup Weekend

In early August a local [Startup Weekend](http://lasvegas.startupweekend.org/) competition took place. I hadn't planned on attending, but soon after it started a friend asked me to come join his team. They called themselves Plus1 Analytics, and meant to provide high-end gaming analytics for casinos. I met up with the team and got to work generating graphs with their data. Over the weekend we built our demo product, and then on the final day we presented it to the judges. After a quick decision they announced [we had won](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/plus1-analytics-seizes-top-spot-193000488.html)!

Plus1 Analytics was officially born, kicking off with 6 months of free office space, and a team that would last almost as long.

### Got my first developer job
After Startup Weekend the team agreed to continue with Plus1 on the side, as everyone on the team had full time jobs. This prompted me to start looking around for my first full-time developer position.

I did a few interviews and was made an offer by two companies. The first was an early stage, but funded, tech startup working on business crowdfunding. The second was local show production company that ran a network of sites for selling tickets to their shows. Both offers were made at the same time, and I had to choose between them. The first company was super cool about giving me time to make a decision, and wanted to fly me out to LA to meet their CTO, who offered to mentor me as well. The second wanted a decision immediately.

I was immature and unconfident in my skills, so the thought of letting the first company down scared me.  Also I felt preasurred by the second company to make the decision, and so after agonizing over the decision I went with them. I started there October 1st, and immediately found myself in an environment were quality was neglected, old technologies were enforced, and new ideas ignored.

### Went on a roadtrip to San Diego

At the beginning of November I took a trip out to San Diego for a few days with a friend. One of my favorite bands, [Switchfoot](https://twitter.com/switchfoot), was playing a hometown show while debuting their surf film _[Fading West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ1ynQ46984)_, and it had been too long since I had been to the beach.

It was my first time in San Diego, and I liked it alot. Really laidback environment, and someplace I definetly want to spend more time.

### Left my first developer job
Fast foward to January and I was getting pretty tired of the show company job. The atmosphere was pretty toxic, no one enjoyed working there and I can't count how many people I saw fired. I spent two months working on building out a new product with virtually no purpose, only to have it shelved on completetion. Office politics killed any innovation and after my plan for a new node.js-based project was shot down, I gave up trying. I got bored pretty quickly of sitting around doing nothing so I quit.

### Went on a ski trip to Lake Tahoe
Towards the middle of January my dad and I roadtripped up to Lake Tahoe to do some skiing. In the 70's he had been a ski coach at Heavenly Valley, so the area holds alot of meaning for him. The snow wasn't good when we went, but we still had a great time.

We stayed with an old friend of mine, who wanted to discuss the posibility of starting a company together. Way back in the day, he had been the first to show me web design, and over the years we had done some work together on and off. He had gone to college to get a software engineering degree, and then go a job at a big firm in Silicon Valley.  We both had similiar goals for what we wanted to see in our own company, so we decieded to get something going.

### Went scuba diving in Daytona
In February I flew down to my home state of Florida to meet up with my friend, who wanted to introduce me to a potential co-founder and some potential clients.

Overall the trip was a ton of fun - met some really cool people, went scuba diving for the first time (3 miles offshore in 70 feet of water no less), did some deep-sea fishing, and went to the Daytona 500 (6 hour rain delay, ftw!).

Unfortunately, on the business side things didn't go so well. My friend failed to put in the necessary work, the potential co-founding backed out, and I began to realize my friend wasn't who I had once respected. On returning from the trip, I ended my involvement in the company.

### Left one startup..
Since August I had been spending my free time working on Plus1 Analytics. However, after we had won Startup Weekend, things had gotten off on a bad foot and hadn't improved much since then either. One team memeber quit after finding out the two original partners had control of all the equity. Then there was the fight for fair equity. Then there were endless meetings and useless debates with zero progress. There was no leadership in business or engineering.. it was a diasaster.

In March, the two business partners finally decieded that to move forward the company needed funding. After weeks of negotiations with potential investors, they found someone willing to invest $1 million dollars, in return for a large amount of equity. However, due to bad business decision-making early on, all the company's equity had been split up already and so everyone would have to take a cut. The business partners decieded this cut would come from solely the developers' equity. Neither of us developers would agree to such an unfair deal, and without our agreement the deal couldn't go through.

By then there was just so much bad blood that no one was willing to come to terms. The deal fell through, and the company folded.

### ..and joined another
After the end of Plus1, I started freelancing for some great local clients. Until, by complete chance, I got a call from a startup looking for a lead developer. Called PrayerSpark, their mission is to connect people of any belief with prayer practitioners of any religion. I loved the idea when I heard it, and the team behind it is resourceful and experienced. I joined at the beginning of May, with the responsibility of building the web platform from scratch. I leave those details for another post, but just in the past two months I've learned a ton, and look forward to contining to grow with PrayerSpark.

### Did (and didn't) do some other things
Outside of work & learning, I spent time over the past year on some new hobbies. I joined a band, got my motorcycle license and bought a bike, and took up iOS development.

On the downside, I spent far less time exercising and staying fit this year than I did at 19. Sitting in front of a computer and stressing about code all day isn't very healthy, and I've found it far too easy to ignore fitness. Going into 21, I want to focus on getting back to better shape.

### Now, on to 21
When I look back at the past year at being 20, I see a lot of growth. I've been able to experience working at multiple companies and startups, consequently learning many life lessons about businesses and people. I've been able to grow my skills and knowledge from complete noob to a point where I feel comfortable building new products and running a team. I've met new people and been to new places.

But I also see fear, uncertainty and doubt. That was a big recurring theme throughout the past year, I think due in part to so many new experiences. Learning is hard, especially when you are your own teacher, but reaching a level of confidence with your knowledge is even harder. Too many times I let my self-doubt get in the way. I'll save more details more another post, but overcoming this is a huge thing I want to work on.

Now, after one crazy year, here's to another.
